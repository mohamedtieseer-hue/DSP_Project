# DSP Design Report

## 1. Overview
This project implements a Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM) system to combine 4 audio channels into a single composite signal and recover them.

## 2. Filtering Strategy
To demonstrate distinct DSP operations, we applied 4 different filters to the 4 input channels (derived from 2 stereo files).
- **Channel Slot 1**: Lowpass Filter (Cutoff 2000Hz). Isolates bass and fundamental speech frequencies.
- **Channel Slot 2**: Bandpass Filter (2000Hz - 5000Hz). Captures the main vocal presence and mid-range instruments.
- **Channel Slot 3**: Bandpass Filter (5000Hz - 10000Hz). Captures high-mids and harmonics.
- **Channel Slot 4**: Highpass Filter (Cutoff > 10000Hz). Captures "air", brilliance, and high-frequency noise/detail.

*Impact*: Each channel occupies a distinct slice of the baseband spectrum before modulation, though the content was artificially restricted by the filters themselves.

## 3. Modulation (FDM)
We used **Amplitude Modulation (AM-DSB-SC)**.
Formula: $s(t) = m(t) \cdot \cos(2\pi f_c t)$

**Carrier Selection based on 192kHz Upsampling**:
To avoid aliasing and overlapping, we upsampled the processing chain to 192kHz.
- **Carrier 1 (10 kHz)**: For the Lowpass signal.
- **Carrier 2 (25 kHz)**: For the Mid-range signal.
- **Carrier 3 (45 kHz)**: For the High-mid signal.
- **Carrier 4 (70 kHz)**: For the Highpass signal.

These carriers leave ample "Guard Bands" between the modulated spectra to prevent crosstalk.

## 4. Demodulation & Recovery
The recovery process involves:
1. **Bandpass Filtering**: Isolating the specific chunk of spectrum around the carrier.
2. **Coherent Detection**: Multiplying by $\cos(2\pi f_c t)$ again.
3. **Lowpass Filtering**: Removing the double-frequency term ($2f_c$) generated by the mixing process.
4. **Downsampling**: Returning to the original 44.1kHz for playback.

## 5. User Interaction (Channel Ordering)
The GUI allows changing the order of channels. Changing the order assigns different audio content to different filter/carrier paths.
- For example, if "File 1 Left" is assigned to Slot 1, it gets Lowpassed. If assigned to Slot 4, it gets Highpassed.
- This effectively changes the "Texture" of the received signal if the listener focuses on specific frequencies.

## 6. Screenshots
(Screenshots would be generated by running the app. The GUI displays 3 distinct rows of plots corresponding to the stages above.)
